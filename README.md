# **Cybersecurity Global Threats Analysis (2018-2024)**

## **Project Overview**
This interactive Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of global cybersecurity incidents between 2018 and 2024. It leverages a global dataset to uncover patterns across various attack types, vulnerabilities, impacted industries, and the financial impact of security breaches. The dashboard is designed to help organizations better understand their cybersecurity risk landscape and make informed decisions about risk mitigation and resource allocation.

## **Dashboard Structure**
The dashboard is split into two primary pages:

### **Page 1: Yearly Trend & Financial Loss by Industry**
- **Yearly Trend of Global Threats**  
  This page visualizes global cybersecurity incidents over time, focusing on attack trends, incident frequency, and year-on-year analysis. Users can explore the rise or decline in cyber threats globally, providing insights into the evolving cybersecurity landscape.
  
- **Financial Loss by Industry**  
  This section highlights the financial impact of cybersecurity incidents across various industries (e.g., healthcare, finance, technology). It compares the financial losses due to cyber threats, helping organizations understand which sectors face the most significant economic risks.

### **Page 2: Attack Types, Sources, and Vulnerabilities**
- **Attack Types Analysis**  
  This page provides a detailed breakdown of various cybersecurity attack types, including phishing, ransomware, data breaches, and DDoS attacks. It presents the frequency of each attack type over time and allows users to filter by region, severity, and industry.

- **Sources of Attacks**  
  This section highlights the origin or source of cybersecurity incidents, helping users identify where attacks are most commonly launched from and the patterns related to attack sources.

- **Vulnerabilities and Exploited Mechanisms**  
  This page delves into the most common vulnerabilities exploited by cybercriminals, providing insights into which vulnerabilities have been targeted across attack types and industries. It also discusses the mechanisms employed in these attacks and suggests countermeasures to protect against them.

## **Goal of the Dashboard**
The goal of this project is to provide cybersecurity professionals, decision-makers, and organizations with a powerful tool to analyze global threats. By uncovering patterns in attack types, vulnerabilities, industries, and financial impacts, this dashboard empowers organizations to identify vulnerabilities within their own systems and prioritize cybersecurity measures accordingly. It also provides a roadmap for improving incident response and strengthening security posture against evolving threats.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Tableau**: To create interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Dataset**: Global cybersecurity incidents dataset (2018-2024) from Kaggle

## **Usage**
Users can interact with the dashboard to filter data based on the year, industry, region, or specific attack type. This allows for detailed analysis and identification of trends that can inform future cybersecurity strategies.
